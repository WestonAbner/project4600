Scenario 1:
	A new user enters the system. First, they make a new account and add their personal 
information to the account. They then login to the system and begin to register for courses. After they 
register for courses, they check their info to make sure that all the courses were registered 
correctly. Then they check their currently enrolled courses to copy the times and dates for their 
classes.

Scenario 2:
      A student is expelled from the university. A staff member logs in and accesses the 
database. The staff member checks the student’s information to make sure they are the correct 
student. They then edit the student’s account information to remove them from their courses. 
They finally add to the student’s information why they were expelled so that the student is not 
let back into the university and in case the university needs it for legal purposes.

Scenario 3:
      A student is getting ready to graduate. The student logs into the system. The student 
checks their GPA to see what should go on their resume. The student then checks their already 
completed courses to see if there are any they need to retake to raise their GPA. A staff 
member then logs into the system. The staff member edits the students account to show that 
they are ready to graduate.
